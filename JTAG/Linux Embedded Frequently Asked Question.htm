<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction.</h1>
This faq has been made from discussions on different linux embedded and
related mailing list and from several articles about linux as embedded
os. You, reader, may find some of your words or explanations in this document.
If you don't complain with this, please send mail to faq@linux-embedded.com
describing the part you are claiming , other comments may also be sent
at the same mail address.
<h1>
<a NAME="1"></a>1 Linux as embedded operating system (EOS)</h1>
The choice between EOS depends on what you have to do. If you are writing
the firmware for a coffee maker, it will be silly to use a unix like OS.
<h2>
<a NAME="1.1"></a>1.1 Why Linux ?</h2>
Linux is freely available , includes a TCP/IP stack, runs over a multitude
of architecture, and provides drivers for almost all devices.
<h2>
<a NAME="1.2"></a>1.2 Minimal configuration ?</h2>
On a i386 architecture, the minimal needs are 386sx16 with 1Mb hard or
flashdisk, and 4 Mb of ram

<h2>
<a NAME="2"></a>2 Linux as real time operating system (RTOS)</h2>
A real time operating system is an operating system whose correctness depends
not only on the logic result, but also on the time that the result is produced.
RTOSs are used in a variety of applications, especially embedded systems,
and are becoming increasingly important. These types of systems usually
involve the control of robots or machinery, telecommunications, air traffic
control and military command and control.
<h2>
<a NAME="2.1"></a>2.1 RT-Linux</h2>
RT-Linux follows the model of Linux: open source code and a cooperative
development environment mainly through the Internet. This results in fast
bug detection and fixing, as well as good user support through mailing
lists and newsgroups. The RT-Linux approach to the design of a real-time
module to the Linux kernel differs from that of traditional RTOSs like
VxWorks and QNX. Instead of having a real-time kernel that provides all
the OS features as real-time features, RT-Linux tries to separate the real-time
services and non real-time services. It leaves all the major OS features
like networking, device access (drivers), GUI system to the Linux kernel,
and provides very basic features for
<br>real-time processing.
