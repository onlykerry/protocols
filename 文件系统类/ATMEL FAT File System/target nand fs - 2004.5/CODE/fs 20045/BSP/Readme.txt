This directory contains several example driver files.
Unless you are using multiple TargetFFS volumes, only
one driver file should be linked into the library.

The drivers whose names begin with 'r' are RAM based
drivers (they simulate Flash using RAM). It is often
convenient to use these driver to test your port before
writing and testing a new flash driver.
